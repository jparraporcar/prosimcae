              "This video displays an isovolume zone marking temperatures within a specified range, highlighting the 3D distribution of cooler air. The room, initially at 300K, experiences about a max. of 1.5K drop in these regions, while other areas remain above the threshold. This limited cooling area indicates suboptimal air distribution, and potentially the need for higher AC power resulting in an increase in energy costs with the current AC position.",
