          "paragraph1": "<p class=\"mb-4\">The Finite Element Method (FEM) is a numerical technique widely used in engineering to predict how physical objects or systems behave under various conditions. It splits a structure into smaller parts, called elements, which connect at nodes. Each element is assigned properties that replicate the real material, so the virtual model closely mimics reality. This approach is especially helpful when analyzing shapes or materials that would be difficult or expensive to test through conventional methods.</p><p class=\"mb-4\">For instance, imagine a wooden chair and the need to see how it bends under different weights. Instead of building multiple prototypes, a computer-based FEM model is generated. The seat, legs, and supports are broken down into elements. Applying a simulated load helps identify weak spots and guides design adjustments, visualizing stress and strain distributions under daily or extreme conditions.</p>",

Tools like <strong>CalculiX</strong> allow for <strong>static analysis</strong> to assess stress distribution and ensure that the part meets structural requirements before manufacturing.</li><li><strong>Vibrations and resonance:</strong> Mechanical oscillations can cause failures when they match the <strong>natural frequencies</strong> of a part, leading to excessive deformations or loosening of joints. In <strong>structures subjected to dynamic loads</strong>, such as machinery bases, poor design can amplify vibrations and reduce system lifespan. Through <strong>modal analysis in CalculiX</strong>, critical frequencies can be identified and the geometry optimized to avoid dangerous resonances.</li><li><strong>Design defects:</strong> Poorly optimized geometries can create <strong>stress concentrations</strong> in critical areas, reducing mechanical resistance and increasing the likelihood of failure. Poorly designed joints, excessively small fillet radii, or abrupt section changes can act as weak points. Simulations help detect these issues and enable redesigns for better stress distribution.</li><li><strong>Impact failures:</strong> Some parts must withstand shocks without suffering structural damage.
